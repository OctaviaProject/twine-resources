### Starting out

When you open Twine, it should look something like this:

Each of the boxes is a **passage**. Passages contain different types of information. Usually passages contain the content of your story and links to other passages, but passages can also serve special purposes. So far we only see the **Start** passage in light green, and two dark green passages called **StoryTitle** and **StoryAuthor**.

The Start passage is important because it's where your story begins! Think of it as the entry point to the world you're going to create, like the gate to an inviting garden. When someone reads your story, it is the first thing they'll see.

### Editing

To edit or view any passage, simply double click the box. This will open a new window where you can add or edit text. Let's try editing the Start passage:

The **Title** field is where you give the passage a name. The start passage *must* be called "Start" but other passages can be named in any way you'd like, as long as each passage has its own unique name. We'll get into the **Tags** field later - tags help us group passages together, which can be very useful! Finally, the large text box is where the content of the passage goes. 

### Special passages

While you're at it, you can try editing the two special passages. When we launch the story in the next step, you'll see how the **StoryTitle** and **StoryAuthor** passages are used.

### Test play

Luckily for us, it's very easy to launch a test version of a Twine story in progress. Find **Test Play** in the **Build** menu, or simply push âŒ˜+T or ctrl+T. The story should launch in a new browser window.

In the upper left hand corner of the story, you find the title that you put in the **StoryTitle** special passage, and the name of the author in the **StoryAuthor** passage. On the right hand side, you can find the glorious, immensely beautiful text from your **Start** passage! Huzzah! Can this day get any better?
