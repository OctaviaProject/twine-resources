### Creating passages

Now that we know how to edit passages, we can learn how to create new ones. After that we can link them together and create various pathways between the passages.

There are a few ways to create a new passage. The first way is through the menubar under **Story > New > Passage**. The second way is by the keyboard shortcut: **âŒ˜+N** or **ctrl+N**. The third way is by clicking the paper icon in the upper left hand corner of Twine. Whichever way you do it, you'll see the same result, a new passage represented by a box with a blue header in the workspace of your Twine story.

When you double click the new passage it should look familiar - it's exactly the same as the Start passage, except it has a different Title. Give your new passage a title. In this example we'll use "pockets" as the title of our new passage, and we'll enter some text like "Hello my new passage ilysm <3."

### Linking passages

Now that we have a new passage we can link it to the first one. We do this by putting **double brackets** around the name of the passage we want to link to, like this:

	[[pockets]]

If we insert this into the Start passage and test it out, we'll see a link to the new passage appear!

By clicking "pockets" the content of the new passage we created appears on the screen. Make sure you type the exact name of the passage you want to link to, including any capital letters. This is called **case sensitivity**: in programming, it's usually important whether letters are captialized or not. 

What if we want the link text to be different? To do this, we separate the link text from the passage name with a pipe character \|, that vertical line thing on the right hand side of your keyboard. 

	[[The text I want to display|title of my passage]]

Let's change our link so that it displays "Check your pockets." instead of the passage name.

	[[Check your pockets.|pockets]]

Be sure to format your links *exactly* as above. For example, there shouldn't be any spaces before or after the \| symbol, and the title has to match the passage title exactly. It can be helpful to give your passages titles that are simple to type.

Links can be placed anywhere in the body of a passage - as many as you want! They can go in the middle of sentences, scattered throughout the text, or at the end of passage. Links to new passages can represent actions, movement, details, or simply a pause or delineation in the story, like a new paragraph or a new chapter.

### Save your story

Remember to save your story frequently! In the **File** menu, click **Save Story** and choose a location for your story file. This file will contain *all* aspects of your story, including images, stylesheets, and all of the story text and links. Put it in a place you'll remember, like a **twines** folder on your desktop.

### Previous

Twine comes equipped with **functions** that enable you to create more complex stories. We'll get into many of the functions Twine has to offer later, but for now we can use a simple one called ``previous``. This function will spit out the name of the passage that the reader came from, making it easy to create a "Back" button:

	[[Back|previous()]]

This can be handy when there are more than one (maybe a whole lot) of ways to reach a passage.

### Story shapes

Trees, long paths without branching, grids, circles, trees where the branches meet again.

### Exercises and things to ponder

Here are a few things to try, now that you know all about how to link passages.

1. Create a story where you can reach a passage in more than one way. Use ``previous`` to send the reader back from this passage.

2. Create a passage with the title StoryMenu. It will become a special passage with a green header. The menu passage will be accessible from the sidebar of the story, where the story title and author are. Use the ``previous`` macro to go back to the right spot in the story.

3. Create a story that never ends. What is the smallest number of passages you need?

4. Take a look at the [syntax documentation](http://twinery.org/wiki/syntax) on the official Twine wiki. Can you create a **numbered list** in a passage? Can you make a list of links to other passages?

5. When a passage doesn't have any outgoing links, what color is it? Why is a passage like this important?
