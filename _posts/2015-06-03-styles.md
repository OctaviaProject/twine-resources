### Styling your story

The default look and feel of a Twine story is pretty simple. The background is always black, text is always white, and links are blue. This can be fine for some types of stories, but sometimes we want to add some custom colors, fonts, or backgrounds. In this section we'll learn how to.. 

1. Use **stylesheets** to customize your story.
2. Use hexadecimal color codes.
3. Use **tags** to apply stylesheets only to certain passages.

### Global stylesheets

To get started, we'll create a stylesheet that will apply to *all* of our passages. Start by creating a new stylesheet passage by navigating to **Story > New > Stylesheet** in the menubar. You'll see a passage with a red banner appear in your Twine workspace. Open it up and you'll see the content of the stylesheet in all its glory!

![Stylesheet](images/styles/1.png)

There are four sections to the stylesheet, and each of the sections will control how a certain part of the story will look. The four sections listed are ``body``, ``.passage``, ``.passage a``, and ``.passage a:hover``. In each of these sections we'll put **statements** that will determine how things look. If we put a statement in the ``body`` section, it will affect the entire page. Statements in the ``.passage`` section will only affect the passage text. The ``.passage a`` section only affects the links, and the ``.passage a:hover`` section only affects the links when we're hovering over them.

Now that we know what each section applies to, let's see some examples of what to do! Let's start by changing the background color. Try making your body section look like this:

    body {
        background-color: purple;
    }

Here we've added the statement ``background-color: purple;``. Statements consist of a property (``background-color``) a colon (``:``), a value to assign to the property (``purple``) and a semicolon (``;``). For your statmeent to work, it has to have all of these parts (don't forget those semicolons...). When you launch your story, you should have a purple background! Magnificent... now let's change the color of the text of the passages:

    .passage {
        color: pink;
    }

Lo and behold, by inserting the ``color: pink;`` statement, the text is now pink. Can you make the color of links another color? And the color of the links when you hover your mouse over them yet another color?

You can also change the size of the passage text with a different statement in the ``.passage`` section.

    .passage {
        color: pink;
        font-size: 16px;
    }

Our text will still be pink, but it will be a bit bigger! What does ``16px`` mean, though? Font sizes can be set in different units, but one of the easiest is with pixel values. Basically, the bigger then number before the ``px``, the bigger the font size. ``12px`` is a normal size, so let's make it bigger. Because we *CAN*...

### Special colors

When picking colors for backgrounds, text, or links, you can either use the names of certain colors, or the color's **hexadecimal** code. You can use the names of most common colors (think red, blue, green, pink, purple, orange, turquoise. Not mauve, ochre, split-pea soup...). If you have a really specific color in mind, you can find its hexadecimal code and use that! 

A hexadecimal (or hex) code starts with a pound sign (``#``) and is followed by six hexadecimal numerals. Hexadecimal numerals are like regular base 10 numerals, except they're in base 16 and they go from 0 to f instead of 0 to 9. Counting in hex looks like "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, 10, 11, 12, ...". The number f in hex is like 15 in base 10. And 10 in hex is 16 base 10. Kind of weird for humans, but for computers it's convenient this way. Computers tend to like numbers that have a represenatation in base 16.

Hexadecimal colors are composed of red, green, and blue parts. The first two digits are the amount of red, the second two digits are the amount of green, and the last two digits are the amount of blue. What do you think happens when we don't have any red, green, or blue, like this?

    #000000

This is the hex representation for black. If we want to add a bit of red, we can toss some in by putting a higher number for the first two digits:

    #440000

This gives us a dark brownish red. If we want a pure red, we can put the highest number for the red component, which is ``ff``:

    #ff0000

By the same token, pure green is ``#00ff00`` and blue is ``#0000ff``. This works for shades of red, green, or blue, but what if we want more complicated mixtures of the colors? What if we want a yellowish color for example? There are lots of ways to explore colors and obtain the hex code, but one great way is to use [colorpicker](http://colorpicker.com).

### Tags

The stylesheet we created earlier is a **global** stylesheet. It applies to every single passage in the story. If you want some passages to look one way, and other passages to look a different way, we can give our passages tags. Tags are like different colored post-it notes that we can stick to our passages. Once we stick tags onto our passages, stylesheets can figure out which passages to affect.

To tag a passage, open it up and put a short name in the **Tags** field. I'm going to tag some passages as "greenworld" and make those passages green (omg how did you guess?).

![Tagging interface](images/styles/2.png)

When you finish tagging a passage, it should have a label at the bottom with your tag. Success. To apply a style to all the passages tagged as "greenworld", tag your stylesheet as "greenworld" as well. To give a passage multiple tags, just separate the tags with spaces:

Once you've tagged the stylesheet, you'll see your stylesheet connected to all of your passages by light gray lines:

### Exercises

1. Try making the passage text ridiculously large.
2. The hex code for black is ``#000000``, and the hex code for white is ``#ffffff``. What are some codes for different shades of gray? Do you notice a pattern in the hex representation of grays?
3. Go to [colorpicker.com](http://colorpicker.com) and find a unique color or two to use for a background or text color.
4. Use tags and stylesheets to create a story where certain passages look different from other passages.
