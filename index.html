<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>You wake up literally inside the Internet, in a Twine tutorial. You brush some ones and zeros off of your face. What do you do?</p>

<pre><code>$ learn twine</code></pre>

<p>OMG perfect choice.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>This tutorial is written for Twine 1.4.2. Get started by downloading Twine (<a href="http://twinery.org/downloads/twine_1.4.2_win.exe">Windows</a>, <a href="http://twinery.org/downloads/twine_1.4.2_osx.zip">Mac</a>). The screenshots will be of the Mac version of Twine, but everything translates directly to the Windows version.</p>

<pre><code>$ wth is twine</code></pre>

<p>If you're looking for background on Twine, see the <a href="http://twinery.org">official site</a>, where you can download the software and find lots of other resources. In a nutshell, Twine is software for creating interactive fiction, games, poetry, visual novels, text adventures, and entire galaxies. </p>

<p><small><i>Note: most of this tutorial will not work in Twine 2. If you want something fun to do, rewrite the whole thing for Twine 2!</i></small></p>

<h3>What to expect</h3>

<p>We're just gonna learn how to make Twine stories bit by bit, and hopefully get into the more interesting aspects of Twine, such as custom formats, CSS, and JavaScript. There will be explanations, examples, and a condensed cheat sheet. This tutorial is suitable for people without any experience with Twine, CSS, or JavaScript.</p>
